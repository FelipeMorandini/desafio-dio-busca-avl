# AVL Tree Project in C++

This project implements an AVL (Adelson-Velskii and Landis) Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree structure. It ensures that the tree maintains a balance such that the difference in height between the left and right subtree of any node is at most one. This results in search, insertion, and removal operations occurring in logarithmic time.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Directory containing the `.cpp` source files.
- `include/`: Directory containing the `.h` header files.
- `build/`: Directory where the compiled objects and executable are stored (generated by `make`).

## Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you will need:

- A C++ compiler, such as GCC or Clang.
- GNU Make (on Unix-like systems) or an equivalent (on Windows systems, such as MinGW or Cygwin, to access `make`).

## How to Build

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory.
3. Run the command `make` to build the project. This will generate the executable in the `build/` directory.

```bash
make
```

## Running the Application

After building, you can run the application as follows:

```bash
./build/avl_tree
```

## Cleaning the Project
To remove the build files and clean the project, run:

```bash
make clean
```

This will remove the build/ directory and all its contents.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the project, whether it be adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation. To contribute:
